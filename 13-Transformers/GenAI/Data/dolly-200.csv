"If I have more pieces at the time of stalemate, have I won?","Stalemate is a situation in chess where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check and has no legal move. Stalemate results in a draw. During the endgame, stalemate is a resource that can enable the player with the inferior position to draw the game rather than lose. In more complex positions, stalemate is much rarer, usually taking the form of a swindle that succeeds only if the superior side is inattentive.[citation needed] Stalemate is also a common theme in endgame studies and other chess problems.

The outcome of a stalemate was standardized as a draw in the 19th century. Before this standardization, its treatment varied widely, including being deemed a win for the stalemating player, a half-win for that player, or a loss for that player; not being permitted; and resulting in the stalemated player missing a turn. Stalemate rules vary in other games of the chess family.","No.

Who was John Moses Browning?,"John Moses Browning (January 23, 1855 – November 26, 1926) was an American firearm designer who developed many varieties of military and civilian firearms, cartridges, and gun mechanisms – many of which are still in use around the world. He made his first firearm at age 13 in his father's gun shop and was awarded the first of his 128 firearm patents on October 7, 1879, at the age of 24. He is regarded as one of the most successful firearms designers of the 19th and 20th centuries and pioneered the development of modern repeating, semi-automatic, and automatic firearms.

Browning influenced nearly all categories of firearms design, especially the autoloading of ammunition. He invented, or made significant improvements to, single-shot, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns. He developed the first reliable and compact autoloading pistols by inventing the telescoping bolt, then integrating the bolt and barrel shroud into what is known as the pistol slide. Browning's telescoping bolt design is now found on nearly every modern semi-automatic pistol, as well as several modern fully automatic weapons. He also developed the first gas-operated firearm, the Colt–Browning Model 1895 machine gun – a system that surpassed mechanical recoil operation to become the standard for most high-power self-loading firearm designs worldwide. He also made significant contributions to automatic cannon development.

Browning's most successful designs include the M1911 pistol, the water-cooled M1917, the air-cooled M1919, and heavy M2 machine guns, the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, and the Browning Auto-5 – the first semi-automatic shotgun. Some of these arms are still manufactured, often with only minor changes in detail and cosmetics to those assembled by Browning or his licensees. The Browning-designed M1911 and Hi-Power are some of the most copied firearms in the world.","John Moses Browning is one of the most well-known designer of modern firearms.

Who is Thomas Jefferson?,"Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Among the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was the Declaration's primary author. Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming the nation's third president in 1801, Jefferson was the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams.","Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, and Founding Father who served as the third president of the United States from 1801 to 1809. Among the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson was the Declaration's primary author. Following the American Revolutionary War and prior to becoming the nation's third president in 1801, Jefferson was the first United States secretary of state under George Washington and then the nation's second vice president under John Adams.

Among the nation's Founding Fathers, Jefferson is considered unmatched in his intellectual depth and breadth. His passionate writings and advocacy for human rights, including freedom of thought, speech, and religion, were a leading inspiration behind the American Revolution, which ultimately gave rise to the American Revolutionary War, American independence, and the United States Constitution. Jefferson's ideas were globally influential in shaping and inspiring the Age of Enlightenment, which proved transformational in the late 17th and 18th centuries. He was a leading proponent of democracy, republicanism, and individual rights, and produced formative documents and decisions at the state, national, and international levels.

During the American Revolution, Jefferson represented Virginia in the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. As a Virginia legislator, he drafted a state law for religious freedom. He served as the second Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the Revolutionary War. In 1785, Jefferson was appointed the United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's first secretary of state under President George Washington from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and James Madison organized the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist Party during the formation of the First Party System. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and Sedition Acts.

Jefferson and Federalist John Adams became friends as well as political rivals, serving in the Continental Congress and drafting the Declaration of Independence together. In the 1796 presidential election between the two, Jefferson came in second, which according to electoral procedure at the time, made him vice president to Adams. Jefferson challenged Adams again in 1800 and won the presidency. After his term in office, Jefferson eventually reconciled with Adams and they shared a correspondence that lasted 14 years. He and Adams both died on the same day, July 4, 1826, which was also the 50th anniversary of Declaration of Independence.

As president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade policies. Starting in 1803, he promoted a western expansionist policy with the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the nation's claimed land area. To make room for settlement, Jefferson began the process of Indian tribal removal from the newly acquired territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was re-elected in 1804, but his second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron Burr. In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the Embargo Act in response to British threats to U.S. shipping. The same year, Jefferson signed the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.

Jefferson was a plantation owner, lawyer, and politician, and mastered many disciplines including surveying, mathematics, horticulture, and mechanics. He was also an architect in the Palladian tradition. Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his appointment as president of the American Philosophical Society. He largely shunned organized religion but was influenced by Christianity, Epicureanism, and deism. Jefferson rejected fundamental Christianity, denying Christ's divinity. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people, including Edward Carrington, John Taylor of Caroline, and James Madison. In 1785, Jefferson authored Notes on the State of Virginia, considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800. Jefferson championed the ideals, values, and teachings of the Enlightenment.

Since the 1790s, Jefferson was rumored to have had children by his sister-in-law and slave Sally Hemings, leading to what is known as the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. A 1998 DNA test concluded that one of Sally Hemings's children, Eston Hemings, was of the Jefferson male line. According to scholarly consensus, based on documentary and statistical evaluation, as well as oral history, Jefferson probably fathered at least six children with Hemings, including four that survived to adulthood.

After retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia, his peaceful acquisition of the Louisiana Territory from France without war or controversy, and his ambitious and successful Lewis and Clark Expedition. Some modern historians are critical of Jefferson's personal involvement with slavery. Jefferson is consistently ranked among the top ten presidents of American history.",information_extraction

What is process mining?,"Process mining is a family of techniques relating the fields of data science and process management to support the analysis of operational processes based on event logs.

Process mining provides novel insights that can be used to identify the executional path taken by operational processes and address their performance and compliance problems.

Process mining starts from event data. Input for process mining is an event log. An event log views a process from a particular angle. Each event in the log should contain (1) a unique identifier for a particular process instance (called case id), (2) an activity (description of the event that is occurring), and (3) a timestamp. There may be additional event attributes referring to resources, costs, etc., but these are optional. With some effort, such data can be extracted from any information system supporting operational processes.

Extract the owner of Lamborghini and a listing of the different types of Huracan cars that Lamborghini has produced for its Motorsport division.,"Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (Italian pronunciation: [autoˈmɔːbili lamborˈɡiːni]) is an Italian manufacturer of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its subsidiary Audi.

Ferruccio Lamborghini (1916–1993), an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.

New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.

Lamborghini currently produces the V12-powered Aventador and the V10-powered Huracán, along with the Urus SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine. In addition, the company produces V12 engines for offshore powerboat racing.

Lamborghini Trattori, founded in 1948 by Ferruccio Lamborghini, is headquartered in Pieve di Cento, Italy and continues to produce tractors. Since 1973, Lamborghini Trattori has been a separate entity from the automobile manufacturer.

Ferruccio Lamborghini with a Jarama and a tractor of his brand
Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.

Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road vehicle.

The Mimrans sold Lamborghini to the Chrysler Corporation in 1987. After replacing the Countach with the Diablo and discontinuing the Jalpa and the LM002, Chrysler sold Lamborghini to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.

In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis, Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.

In 2021, the CEO of Lamborghini said that by 2024 all its models will be hybrid.

HTTP is the foundational and the most popular network protocol across the internet. By using HTTP, REST APIs can fully utilize the internet infrastructure, which greatly reduce the complexity and operational costs. For example, using HTTPS for transport security, and using URL for request routing.

JSON is a simple, stable, and intuitive data format , which is not expected to change ever. This offers great ease of use and stability to REST APIs. For high performance applications, binary formats can be used instead, such as protobuf or thrift.

REST APIs are often designed as CRUD APIs, where API operations are commonly expressed as Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete operations on resources. CRUD operations are naturally mapped to HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE), and API resources can be naturally identified using URLs.",general_qa

"Who are ''The Lumières"" ?",,"The Lumières (literally in English: The Lights) was a cultural, philosophical, literary and intellectual movement beginning in the second half of the 17th century, originating in western Europe and spreading throughout the rest of Europe. It included philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, David Hume, John Locke, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Pierre Bayle and Isaac Newton. This movement is influenced by the scientific revolution in southern Europe arising directly from the Italian renaissance with people like Galileo Galilei. Over time it came to mean the Siècle des Lumières, in English the Age of Enlightenment.[Note 1]

Members of the movement saw themselves as a progressive élite, and battled against religious and political persecution, fighting against what they saw as the irrationality, arbitrariness, obscurantism and superstition of the previous centuries. They redefined the study of knowledge to fit the ethics and aesthetics of their time. Their works had great influence at the end of the 18th century, in the American Declaration of Independence and the French Revolution.

This intellectual and cultural renewal by the Lumières movement was, in its strictest sense, limited to Europe. These ideas were well understood in Europe, but beyond France the idea of ""enlightenment"" had generally meant a light from outside, whereas in France it meant a light coming from within oneself.

In the most general terms, in science and philosophy, the Enlightenment aimed for the triumph of reason over faith and belief; in politics and economics, the triumph of the bourgeois over nobility and clergy.",open_qa

At that time, an estimated four million African Americans were set free.

Support for reparations
Within the political sphere, a bill demanding slavery reparations has been proposed at the national level, the ""Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act,"" which former Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-MI) reintroduced to the United States Congress every year from 1989 until his resignation in 2017. As its name suggests, the bill recommended the creation of a commission to study the ""impact of slavery on the social, political and economic life of our nation""., however there are cities and institutions which have initiated reparations in the US (see § Legislation and other actions for a list).

In 1999, African-American lawyer and activist Randall Robinson, founder of the TransAfrica advocacy organization, wrote that America's history of race riots, lynching, and institutional discrimination have ""resulted in $1.4 trillion in losses for African Americans"". Economist Robert Browne stated the ultimate goal of reparations should be to ""restore the black community to the economic position it would have if it had not been subjected to slavery and discrimination"". He estimates a fair reparation value anywhere between $1.4 to $4.7 trillion, or roughly $142,000 (equivalent to $162,000 in 2021) for every black American living today. Other estimates range from $5.7 to $14.2 and $17.1 trillion.

In 2014, American journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates published an article titled ""The Case for Reparations"", which discussed the continued effects of slavery and Jim Crow laws and made renewed demands for reparations. Coates refers to Rep. John Conyers Jr.'s H.R.40 Bill, pointing out that Congress's failure to pass this bill expresses a lack of willingness to right their past wrongs.

In September 2016, the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent encouraged Congress to pass H.R.40 to study reparations proposals. Still, the Working Group did not directly endorse any specific reparations proposal. The report noted that there exists a legacy of racial inequality in the United States, explaining that ""Despite substantial changes since the end of the enforcement of Jim Crow and the fight for civil rights, ideology ensuring the domination of one group over another, continues to negatively impact the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today."" The report notes that a ""dangerous ideology of white supremacy inhibits social cohesion among the US population"".

The topic of reparations gained renewed attention in 2020 as the Black Lives Matter movement named reparations as one of their policy goals in the United States.

In 2020, rapper T.I. supported reparations that would give every African American US$1 million and asserted that slavery caused mass incarcerations, poverty, and other ills.","In spite of progressive changes since the end of enforcement of Jim Crow and the successes of the fight for civil rights there are still inherent racial inequalities in the USA which negatively affect the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of African Americans today.  A United Nations report of 2016 did not endorse a specific reparations proposal, but did call out that there is an ideology of white supremacy present in the population of the United States that inhibits social cohesion.  Further arguments have been made identifying slavery as a cause of mass incarcerations, poverty and other ills that affect today’s African Americans.
It could be argued that there is an inherent acknowledgement that the case exists to examine the impact of slavery on the social, political and economic life of the United States in the annual submission to Congress of the ""Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act”.  There are also individual cities within the USA which have instituted reparations.  Estimates of the cost to African Americans of the United States’ history of discrimination have been estimated variously at $1.4 trillion, $4.7 trillion, $5.7 trillion, $14.2 trillion and $17.1 trillion.  These estimates express the projected cost in $ to restore the black community to the economic position it would have if it had not been subjected to slavery and discrimination.",summarization

Did dinosaurs have lips?,,"Recent research suggests that the popular perception that dinosaurs had exposed teeth may be incorrect, and the current hypothesis is that the Tyrannosaurus rex did indeed have lips. A 2023 study by Dr Mark Witton of the University of Portsmouth said popular depictions of dinosaurs in movies like Jurassic Park are out of date. The study examined a large tooth that had spent over 500 days in the mouth of a Tyrannosaurus rex with no evidence of substantial wear, which is consistent with all findings of teeth found in the theropod family of dinosaurs. When contrasted with alligators and crocodiles, who have no lips and have more easily damaged teeth the theory says the evidence points to theropods, including Tyrannosaurus rex did indeed have lips. There would have been expected to be wear on the thin enamel on the teeth far more consistent with modern animals like crocodiles if dinosaurs had no lips.",general_qa

Who was the first to record the Needles and Pins song?,"""Needles and Pins"" is a rock song credited to American writers Jack Nitzsche and Sonny Bono. Jackie DeShannon recorded it in 1963 and other versions followed. The most successful ones were by the Searchers, whose version reached No. 1 on the UK singles chart in 1964, and Smokie, who had a worldwide hit in 1977. Others who recorded the song include the Ramones, Gene Clark, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers with Stevie Nicks.

Jackie DeShannon version (1963)
In his autobiography, Bono states that he sang along with Nitzsche's guitar-playing, thus creating both the tune and the lyrics, being guided by the chord progressions. However, Jackie DeShannon claims that the song was written at the piano, and that she was a full participant in the song's creation, along with Nitzsche and Bono, although she did not get formal credit.

DeShannon was the first to record the song; in the US it peaked at number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in May 1963. Though it was only a minor US hit, DeShannon's recording of the song topped the charts in Canada, hitting number one on the CHUM Chart in July 1963",The first artist to record Needles and Pins song was DeShannon.,closed_qa
Provide me a list of the different types of harnesses used in rock climbing,"Different types of climbing warrant particular features for harnesses. Sport climbers typically use minimalistic harnesses, some with sewn-on gear loops. Alpine climbers often choose lightweight harnesses, perhaps with detachable leg loops. Big Wall climbers generally prefer padded waist belts and leg loops. There are also full body harnesses for children, whose pelvises may be too narrow to support a standard harness safely. These harnesses prevent children from falling even when inverted, and are either manufactured for children or constructed out of webbing. Some climbers use full body harnesses when there is a chance of inverting, or when carrying a heavy bag. There are also chest harnesses, which are used only in combination with a sit harness. Test results from UIAA show that chest harnesses do not put more impact on the neck than sit harnesses, giving them the same advantages as full body harness.

Apart from these harnesses, there are also caving and canyoning harnesses, which all serve different purposes. For example, a caving harness is made of tough waterproof and unpadded material, with dual attachment points. Releasing the maillon from these attachment points loosens the harness quickly.

Canyoning harnesses are somewhat like climbing harnesses, often without the padding, but with a seat protector, making it more comfortable to rappel. These usually have a single attachment point of Dyneema.","Minimalistic Harness: has gear loops that are sewn on
Lightweight Harness: has leg loops that are removable
Big Wall Harness: uses padded waist belts and leg loops

What is enriched air and why would divers dive with enriched air?,,"Enriched air, also known as nitrox, is one kind of air with more than 21% oxygen. 21% oxygen is the normal air we breathe on the earth. The primary benefit of using enriched air is to extend the diver's bottom time, and reduce the need to push to no decompression limit. This advantage is really beneficial in deeper diving. 
For example, at 80 feet of depth, normal air can last around 30 min, while enriched air of 32% oxygen can last for 45 min and 36% can last for 55 min. 
While enriched air is really beneficial in extending bottom time, it is important that divers get trained to use it before diving with enriched air.",general_qa

Without quoting directly from the text give me a summary of the history of the Key Lime Pie.,"Key lime pie is probably derived from the ""Magic Lemon Cream Pie"" published in a promotional brochure by Borden, a producer of condensed milk, in 1931. The recipe is attributed to Borden's fictional spokesperson, Jane Ellison, and includes condensed milk, lemon juice and rind, and egg yolks. It is covered with meringue, baked, and served cold. According to the pastry chef Stella Parks, users of the recipe altered it with local ingredients; she describes it as ""a stunning reminder of how deeply America's traditions are shaped by advertising"".

A ""Tropical Lime Chiffon Pie"", using condensed milk and egg yolks, is documented in a 1933 Miami newspaper article. An ""icebox lime pie"", was mentioned as a specialty of the Florida Keys in 1935.[full citation needed] and a recipe under the name ""Key Lime Pie"" was published in 1940.[full citation needed]

No earlier solid sources are known, despite appeals to the public. A 1927 Key West Women's Club cookbook does not mention the recipe. A 1926 restaurant menu includes ""lime pie"", but it is unclear what it was. Various accounts claim that it was known earlier, but none were recorded before 1933. A widely-reported story claims that William Curry's cook Aunt Sally invented it in the late 19th century. But there is no evidence for this, and the oldest version of this story dates to only 1895, in promotional materials for a Bed and Breakfast in Curry's former house.

It was in the 1950s that Key lime pie was promoted as Florida's ""most famous treat"" and in 1987 as ""the greatest of all regional American desserts.""","Key lime pie is an American dessert pie. It is made of lime juice, egg yolks, and sweetened condensed milk. It is best served with meringue topping and is typically cooked in a graham cracker crust.

Is beauty objective or subjective?,,"The opinions on this question vary from person to person. 
Statistically, a pattern of preference is easily visible on what people would describe as beautiful. An evident example of this phenomenon is a beauty standard for women and men. Society seems to agree on what features, both physical and internal, can deem a person beautiful. The standard of beauty is also projected beyond humans, onto animal breeds, for example, in cat shows. 
A link between beauty and how closely it resembles perfection appears to exist. For example, a rose with many petals and no tears or scratches is generally seen as more beautiful than one with fewer, visibly ruined petals. 
However, the question of perfection also raises a problem as it is difficult and arguably impossible to define perfection. Beauty does not necessarily mean perfection. For example, large eyes are statistically considered to be more attractive however, in terms of their biological  purpose they possess no superiority to small eyes. Therefore, both beauty and perfection depend on the perspective or purpose with which you observe an object.

Furthermore, the clear fluctuations through centuries and cultures on what is considered to be beautiful should also be taken into account. Fashion trends and art styles, for instance,  are constantly changing. Additionally, the diversity in opinions suggests there is nothing that is considered beautiful by everyone, so even if the majority deem a particular object or thing as beautiful, it’s beauty remains subjective because it remains based on an ever-changing preference rather than objective truth.",general_qa

Give me five ways in which I can make my homebrew beer more interesting,,"There are infinite ways to create interesting flavours, that are either personal favourites or attempt to replicate classic beers and beer styles. There are a number of factors that make up a beers flavour profile and part of the enjoyment brewing your own beer at home, is that you can play around with each of these to change the flavour and character of your homebrew beer. Here are five ways in which you can change your own homebrew recipe to add interesting flavours or alternatively you can alter an existing homebrew recipe shared by somebody else or a brewery.

1. Use different hops
There is a huge variety of hops available to homebrewers and each of these can introduce its own particular flavour and aroma to your beer, ranging from pineapple and apricots, to pine trees and woods, to grapefruit pith and lemon zest. By using a different hop in your recipe either from the same family or from an entirely different family of hops, you can easily add interesting and often radical changes to the flavour profile of your beer. However, depending on when the hops are added in the brewing process, you can also increase/decrease the levels of bitterness of your beer, due to different hop varieties having different levels of alpha acids.

2. Use a different yeast
Besides fermenting the beer, yeast leave behind lots of interesting flavours and can give your homebrew it's own subtle character. For example, English yeast strains can add malty and sweet flavours, California yeast tends to create a clean and crisp beer, whilst saison yeast adds bright and fruity flavours to your beer.

3. Use different grains
Changing the amount of base malts can increase or decrease the alcohol in your finished beer. Trying swapping one base malt for another, like American pale malts for a British variety, and look for the subtle differences between them. You can also play around with the specialty grains, like using a slightly darker roast.

4. Add fruit, spices or herbs
Fruits, spices, herbs, and other ingredients are a great way to add an entirely personal character to your homebrew. Anything from fresh strawberries and basil to vanilla beans and cardamom can really complement the other malty, hoppy flavours in a beer. 

5. Alter your water profile
Different beer styles will typically be best achieved with a suitable water profile, with different levels of minerals to achieve the desired flavour profile. By adjusting the amounts of specific minerals found in your brewing water, beer can be made to taste fuller bodied, sweeter, drier, more bitter, or even sour.",brainstorming

What is HiFI?,"High fidelity (often shortened to Hi-Fi or HiFi) is the high-quality reproduction of sound. It is popular with audiophiles and home audio enthusiasts. Ideally, high-fidelity equipment has inaudible noise and distortion, and a flat (neutral, uncolored) frequency response within the human hearing range.

High fidelity contrasts with the lower-quality “lo-fi” sound produced by inexpensive audio equipment, AM radio, or the inferior quality of sound reproduction that can be heard in recordings made until the late 1940s.","Bell Laboratories began experimenting with a range of recording techniques in the early 1930s. Performances by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra were recorded in 1931 and 1932 using telephone lines between the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and the Bell labs in New Jersey. Some multitrack recordings were made on optical sound film, which led to new advances used primarily by MGM (as early as 1937) and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation (as early as 1941). RCA Victor began recording performances by several orchestras using optical sound around 1941, resulting in higher-fidelity masters for 78-rpm discs. During the 1930s, Avery Fisher, an amateur violinist, began experimenting with audio design and acoustics. He wanted to make a radio that would sound like he was listening to a live orchestra—that would achieve high fidelity to the original sound. After World War II, Harry F. Olson conducted an experiment whereby test subjects listened to a live orchestra through a hidden variable acoustic filter. The results proved that listeners preferred high-fidelity reproduction, once the noise and distortion introduced by early sound equipment was removed.[citation needed]

Beginning in 1948, several innovations created the conditions that made major improvements of home-audio quality possible:

Reel-to-reel audio tape recording, based on technology taken from Germany after WWII, helped musical artists such as Bing Crosby make and distribute recordings with better fidelity.
The advent of the 33⅓ rpm Long Play (LP) microgroove vinyl record, with lower surface noise and quantitatively specified equalization curves as well as noise-reduction and dynamic range systems. Classical music fans, who were opinion leaders in the audio market, quickly adopted LPs because, unlike with older records, most classical works would fit on a single LP.
Higher quality turntables, with more responsive needles
FM radio, with wider audio bandwidth and less susceptibility to signal interference and fading than AM radio.
Better amplifier designs, with more attention to frequency response and much higher power output capability, reproducing audio without perceptible distortion.
New loudspeaker designs, including acoustic suspension, developed by Edgar Villchur and Henry Kloss with improved bass frequency response.
In the 1950s, audio manufacturers employed the phrase high fidelity as a marketing term to describe records and equipment intended to provide faithful sound reproduction. Many consumers found the difference in quality compared to the then-standard AM radios and 78-rpm records readily apparent and bought high-fidelity phonographs and 33⅓ LPs such as RCA's New Orthophonics and London's FFRR (Full Frequency Range Recording, a UK Decca system). Audiophiles paid attention to technical characteristics and bought individual components, such as separate turntables, radio tuners, preamplifiers, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Some enthusiasts even assembled their own loudspeaker systems. With the advent of integrated multi-speaker console systems in the 1950s, hi-fi became a generic term for home sound equipment, to some extent displacing phonograph and record player.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the development of stereophonic equipment and recordings led to the next wave of home-audio improvement, and in common parlance stereo displaced hi-fi. Records were now played on a stereo. In the world of the audiophile, however, the concept of high fidelity continued to refer to the goal of highly accurate sound reproduction and to the technological resources available for approaching that goal. This period is regarded as the ""Golden Age of Hi-Fi"", when vacuum tube equipment manufacturers of the time produced many models considered superior by modern audiophiles, and just before solid state (transistorized) equipment was introduced to the market, subsequently replacing tube equipment as the mainstream technology.

In the 1960s, the FTC with the help of the audio manufacturers came up with a definition to identify high fidelity equipment so that the manufacturers could clearly state if they meet the requirements and reduce misleading advertisements.

The metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) was adapted into a power MOSFET for audio by Jun-ichi Nishizawa at Tohoku University in 1974. Power MOSFETs were soon manufactured by Yamaha for their hi-fi audio amplifiers. JVC, Pioneer Corporation, Sony and Toshiba also began manufacturing amplifiers with power MOSFETs in 1974. In 1977, Hitachi introduced the LDMOS (lateral diffused MOS), a type of power MOSFET. Hitachi was the only LDMOS manufacturer between 1977 and 1983, during which time LDMOS was used in audio power amplifiers from manufacturers such as HH Electronics (V-series) and Ashly Audio, and were used for music and public address systems. Class-D amplifiers became successful in the mid-1980s when low-cost, fast-switching MOSFETs were made available. Many transistor amps use MOSFET devices in their power sections, because their distortion curve is more tube-like.

A popular type of system for reproducing music beginning in the 1970s was the integrated music centre—which combined a phonograph turntable, AM-FM radio tuner, tape player, preamplifier, and power amplifier in one package, often sold with its own separate, detachable or integrated speakers. These systems advertised their simplicity. The consumer did not have to select and assemble individual components or be familiar with impedance and power ratings. Purists generally avoid referring to these systems as high fidelity, though some are capable of very good quality sound reproduction.

Audiophiles in the 1970s and 1980s preferred to buy each component separately. That way, they could choose models of each component with the specifications that they desired. In the 1980s, a number of audiophile magazines became available, offering reviews of components and articles on how to choose and test speakers, amplifiers, and other components.

Listening tests
See also: Codec listening test
Listening tests are used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile magazines, and audio engineering researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done in such a way that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid-state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgment. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use blind tests, in which listeners cannot see the components being tested. A commonly used variant of this test is the ABX test. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample A, the reference, and sample B, an alternative), and one unknown sample X, for three samples total. X is randomly selected from A and B, and the subject identifies X as being either A or B. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is transparent, a properly conducted double-blind test can prove that a method is not transparent.

Blind tests are sometimes used as part of attempts to ascertain whether certain audio components (such as expensive, exotic cables) have any subjectively perceivable effect on sound quality. Data gleaned from these blind tests is not accepted by some audiophile magazines such as Stereophile and The Absolute Sound in their evaluations of audio equipment. John Atkinson, current editor of Stereophile, stated that he once purchased a solid-state amplifier, the Quad 405, in 1978 after seeing the results from blind tests, but came to realize months later that ""the magic was gone"" until he replaced it with a tube amp. Robert Harley of The Absolute Sound wrote, in 2008, that: ""...blind listening tests fundamentally distort the listening process and are worthless in determining the audibility of a certain phenomenon.""

Doug Schneider, editor of the online Soundstage network, refuted this position with two editorials in 2009. He stated: ""Blind tests are at the core of the decades' worth of research into loudspeaker design done at Canada's National Research Council (NRC). The NRC researchers knew that for their result to be credible within the scientific community and to have the most meaningful results, they had to eliminate bias, and blind testing was the only way to do so."" Many Canadian companies such as Axiom, Energy, Mirage, Paradigm, PSB, and Revel use blind testing extensively in designing their loudspeakers. Audio professional Dr. Sean Olive of Harman International shares this view.",information_extraction

How much music theory knowledge is required to compose music?,,"Technically speaking, very little music theory knowledge is “required” to compose music. Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. 

When you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you’ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that’s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don’t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.

Summarize in one sentence this article about a famous song.,"""I'm an Old Cowhand (From the Rio Grande)"" is a comic song written by Johnny Mercer for the Paramount Pictures release Rhythm on the Range and sung by its star, Bing Crosby. The Crosby commercial recording was made on July 17, 1936, with Jimmy Dorsey & his Orchestra for Decca Records. It was a huge hit in 1936, reaching the No. 2 spot in the charts of the day, and it greatly furthered Mercer's career. Crosby recorded the song again in 1954 for his album Bing: A Musical Autobiography.
Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.

Background
Mercer and his wife were driving across the US en route to his hometown, Savannah, Georgia, after having apparently failed to succeed in Hollywood. Mercer was amused by the sight of cowboys, with spurs and ten-gallon hats, driving cars and trucks instead of riding horses. Singing cowboys were popular in films and on the radio then, and within 15 minutes, writing on the back of an envelope, Mercer transferred the image he was seeing into a song whose satirical lyrics vented some of his own bitter frustration with Hollywood.

The lyrics, about a 20th-century cowboy who has little in common with the cowpunchers of old, have been included in some anthologies of light verse.","I'm an Old Cowhand (From the Rio Grande), written by Johnny Mercer and recorded by Bing Crosby, is popular song from 1936 that satirizes cowboy culture of the time.",summarization

How do you operate a car with a manual transmission?,,"Through a combination of a shifter and three pedals: gas, brake, and clutch. Press down the clutch pedal with one foot, and the brake with your other foot first and then turn on the engine of the car. It is recommended to shift to neutral immediately after turning on your car and prior to departing. To shift between one of the engaged gears, typically marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 N (for neutral) and R (for reverse), press down on the clutch all the way to the floor and move the shifter to the desired location. Once the car is on and you're in neutral if you want to move forward, press and hold the clutch pedal to the floor and move the shifter to the ""1"" position. Slowly disengage the clutch pedal partially, and while disengaging slowly start to press down on the gas pedal. After gradually pressing more on the gas pedal, slowly remove your foot from the clutch entirely. This will start you in forward motion, and you will be restricted to the speed limit of 1st gear. You can track this limit through the RPM (revolutions per minute) gauge on the dashboard of your car. Typically you want to keep the RPMs between 1500-4000. If the RPMs start to decrease to 1500-2000 that is a sign you want to shift from a higher gear to a lower gear (i.e. 2nd gear to 1st gear), and as the RPMs increase to 4000, that is an indication you want to shift to a higher gear (i.e. 2nd gear to 3rd gear).",general_qa

Why are so many US Hollywood films made in the state of Georgia?,,"While film in the United States as an audience artform started in New York it moved to Los Angeles for the stated reason of longer and sunnier days.  Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  

This mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.

What is SVM?,"In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. Developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories by Vladimir Vapnik with colleagues (Boser et al., 1992, Guyon et al., 1993, Cortes and Vapnik, 1995, Vapnik et al., 1997[citation needed]) SVMs are one of the most robust prediction methods, being based on statistical learning frameworks or VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974). Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). SVM maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.

In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

The support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data.[citation needed] These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data to groups and, then, to map new data according to these clusters.","SVM stands for """"support vector machine"". It is a machine learning model for supervised learning tasks. It was popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, before deep learning take off. The classic use case is binary classification, but its extension can also do multi-label classification as we as regression. Kernel methods greatly enhanced SVM's capability to perform non-linear machine learning tasks.",closed_qa

write a short essay on California wild fire,,"California is known for its hot, dry summers, which increase the risk of wildfires. Every year, the state experiences dozens of fires, which can be devastating to both the environment and people's homes and businesses.

In recent years, California has seen some of the worst wildfires in its history, with tens of thousands of acres of land destroyed and hundreds of homes lost. These fires are often started by a combination of high temperatures, dry conditions, and strong winds, which can quickly spread flames and make them difficult to control.

The effects of these fires are felt not just by those directly impacted, but by everyone in the state. Smoke and ash from the fires can cause respiratory problems and other health issues, and the destruction of habitats can harm wildlife populations and disrupt entire ecosystems.

Despite the challenges, California has made significant progress in fighting wildfires in recent years. The state has invested in new technologies and equipment to help firefighters respond more quickly and effectively to fires, and has increased efforts to prevent fires from starting in the first place.

While wildfires will likely always be a risk in California, the state's proactive approach to managing them gives hope that we can continue to protect people, wildlife, and the environment from their devastating effects.",creative_writing

Wat id DNA annotation?,,"DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome and determining what those genes do. An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it. Genes in a eukaryotic genome can be annotated using various annotation tools such as FINDER. A modern annotation pipeline can support a user-friendly web interface and software containerization such as MOSGA. Modern annotation pipelines for prokaryotic genomes are Bakta, Prokka and PGAP.

For DNA annotation, a previously unknown sequence representation of genetic material is enriched with information relating genomic position to intron-exon boundaries, regulatory sequences, repeats, gene names and protein products. This annotation is stored in genomic databases such as Mouse Genome Informatics, FlyBase, and WormBase. Educational materials on some aspects of biological annotation from the 2006 Gene Ontology annotation camp and similar events are available at the Gene Ontology website.

The National Center for Biomedical Ontology develops tools for automated annotation of database records based on the textual descriptions of those records.

As a general method, dcGO has an automated procedure for statistically inferring associations between ontology terms and protein domains or combinations of domains from the existing gene/protein-level annotations.",open_qa

"Who coined the phrase ""Bike-shedding"" and when?","The law of triviality is C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 argument that people within an organization commonly or typically give disproportionate weight to trivial issues. Parkinson provides the example of a fictional committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bicycle shed, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important and a far more difficult and complex task.

The law has been applied to software development and other activities. The terms bicycle-shed effect, bike-shed effect, and bike-shedding were coined based on Parkinson's example; it was popularised in the Berkeley Software Distribution community by the Danish software developer Poul-Henning Kamp in 1999 and, due to that, has since become popular within the field of software development generally.

Argument

A bicycle shed
The concept was first presented as a corollary of his broader ""Parkinson's law"" spoof of management. He dramatizes this ""law of triviality"" with the example of a committee's deliberations on an atomic reactor, contrasting it to deliberations on a bicycle shed. As he put it: ""The time spent on any item of the agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum [of money] involved."" A reactor is so vastly expensive and complicated that an average person cannot understand it (see ambiguity aversion), so one assumes that those who work on it understand it. However, everyone can visualize a cheap, simple bicycle shed, so planning one can result in endless discussions because everyone involved wants to implement their own proposal and demonstrate personal contribution.

After a suggestion of building something new for the community, like a bike shed, problems arise when everyone involved argues about the details. This is a metaphor indicating that it is not necessary to argue about every little feature based simply on having the knowledge to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change.

The law of triviality is supported by behavioural research. People tend to spend more time on small decisions than they should, and less time on big decisions than they should. A simple explanation is that during the process of making a decision, one has to assess whether enough information has been collected to make the decision. If people make mistakes about whether they have enough information, they will tend to stop too early for big decisions. The reason is that big decisions require collecting information for a long time. It leaves more time to make a mistake (and stop) before getting enough information. Conversely, for small decisions, where people should stop early, they may continue to ponder for too long by mistake.

Related principles and formulations 
There are several other principles, well-known in specific problem domains, which express a similar sentiment.

Wadler's law, named for computer scientist Philip Wadler, is a principle which asserts that the bulk of discussion on programming-language design centers on syntax (which, for purposes of the argument, is considered a solved problem), as opposed to semantics.

Sayre's law is a more general principle, which holds (among other formulations) that ""In any dispute, the intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the value of the issues at stake""; many formulations of the principle focus on academia.","The phrase ""bike-shedding"" was introduced in 1957 by C.

List the weapons of Goddess Durga in a comma separated manner.,"Durga is a warrior goddess, and she is depicted to express her martial skills. Her iconography typically resonates with these attributes, where she rides a lion or a tiger, has between eight and eighteen hands, each holding a weapon to destroy and create. She is often shown in the midst of her war with Mahishasura, the buffalo demon, at the time she victoriously kills the demonic force. Her icon shows her in action, yet her face is calm and serene. In Hindu arts, this tranquil attribute of Durga's face is traditionally derived from the belief that she is protective and violent not because of her hatred, egotism or getting pleasure in violence, but because she acts out of necessity, for the love of the good, for liberation of those who depend on her, and a mark of the beginning of soul's journey to creative freedom.

Durga traditionally holds the weapons of various male gods of Hindu mythology, which they give her to fight the evil forces because they feel that she is shakti (energy, power). These include the chakra, conch, bow, arrow, sword, javelin, trishula, shield, and a noose. These weapons are considered symbolic by Shakta Hindus, representing self-discipline, selfless service to others, self-examination, prayer, devotion, remembering her mantras, cheerfulness and meditation. Durga herself is viewed as the ""Self"" within and the divine mother of all creation. She has been revered by warriors, blessing their new weapons. Durga iconography has been flexible in the Hindu traditions, where for example some intellectuals place a pen or other writing implements in her hand since they consider their stylus as their weapon.","Chakra, conch, bow, arrow, sword, javelin, trishula, shield, a noose",information_extraction

Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket.

"As a golfer, how can I fix my slice?",,"A common swing fault in golfers is a slice which is caused when the face of the club isn't aligned properly to the swing path of the club.  What will typically happen is at the time of impact, the face is open in relation to the target (ie aimed to the right if you are a right handed golfer) and the swing path is closed in relation to the target (ie aimed to the left if you are a left handed golfer).  When there is a large difference between the path of the swing and the face of the club, the impact will generate a high degree of lateral spin on the ball causing the flight of the ball to curve away from the target.  Here are some ways to fix this swing fault:

1. Grip the club with a stronger grip.  This means the v formed between your thumb and pointer finger on back hand is pointed to your rear shoulder and your opposite hand it also gripping the club more from the back.  This will help you close the face of the club at impact.
2. Focus on keeping the face closed in the backswing.  One fault many amateurs have is the club face opens toward the sky on the backswing too far meaning that the face will need to turn more on the downswing to get to square at impact.  Creating less rotation on the backswing can help with this.  
3. Keeping hips down and back in the downswing.  One fault that can cause inconsistent contact as well as a slice is when the hips thrust forward during the downswing causing the golfer to lift up to counter being too close to the ball which can often cause an over the top, out-to-in swing path.  Try to keep the hips back through the swing and focus on rotating the body to keep forward or lateral movement to a minimum.  

A slice is a very common issue among golfers but knowing the causes and swing faults that lead to a slice can help you think about how you can improve your swing to fix it.",general_qa

Instead of a rifle or shotgun, Americans own ARI5s and other guns that can fire hundreds of bullets per round. Security in America has also increased leaving people to question the need for a personal weapon.
Often a result of having the freedom to easily buy and keep guns is school shootings. Teens who are depressed, lonely, suicidal, or crazy can easily buy or ise their parents guns to shoot and will other students, teachers, or themselves. In late 2022, a six year old brought his father's hand gun to school and shot his teacher. Yes, the gun was licensed and own by the father but why should any US citizen or even person feel safe in this country when the 2nd Amendment exsits? Should anyone trust their freedoms when it is easier to buy a gun than a car?
On the flip side, America's freedom is a gift that many other countries don't give. In 2019 when covid-19 first immerged in China, the country. went on lockdown, and in some cities, still remains so. By the third year of the pandemic, Americans learned of the extreme measures the Chinese government had taken upon its citizens, arresting those who left their homes for any reason, in the worst case. While China's laid protocols were way too extreme, Americans over the pandemic chose their freedom to not wear a mask over the safety of themselves and others, again.
To be clear, freedom and safety are not opposites, and countries who manage both well are impressive to be sure. But Americans are unwilling, to a dangerous level, to let go of some or any of their freedoms, even if it will benefit the overall safety of America. Freedom, in America, is valued above all, and could arguably be our most identifiable trait.",creative_writing

Summarize the rulers of the territory of Albania in this time period.,"The Illyrian Ardiaei tribe, centred in Montenegro, ruled over most of the territory of Albania. Their Ardiaean Kingdom reached its greatest extent under King Agron, the son of Pleuratus II. Agron extended his rule over other neighbouring tribes as well. Following Agron's death in 230 BC, his wife, Teuta, inherited the Ardiaean kingdom. Teuta's forces extended their operations further southwards to the Ionian Sea. In 229 BC, Rome declared war on the kingdom for extensively plundering Roman ships. The war ended in Illyrian defeat in 227 BC. Teuta was eventually succeeded by Gentius in 181 BC. Gentius clashed with the Romans in 168 BC, initiating the Third Illyrian War. The conflict resulted in Roman conquest of the region by 167 BC.

Give me a bunch of ways I can keep my house cool in the summer,,"- Install whole house AC that's integrated with your heating system
- Buy an in-window unit to keep an individual room cool
- Install a whole house fan that pulls in cool air from open windows at night into living area and exhausts the hot air into the attic
- Place fans throughout the house but place them in front of open windows at night to pull in cool air
- Install a swamp cooler, it's sometimes cheaper than installing a full AC system
- Make sure to close windows and curtains in the morning hours after the house cools down over night
- Get a cooler filled with ice and place a fan into it forcing cold air into the room.  The ice will melt fast so be ready to refill often.  Not the most efficient but in a pinch it can help",brainstorming
