0,LG G4 Case Hard Transparent Slim Clear Cover for LG G4,Wireless,"2 issues  -  Once I turned on the circle apps and installed this case,  my battery drained twice as fast as usual.  I ended up turning off the circle apps, which kind of makes the case just a case...  with a hole in it.  Second,  the wireless charging doesn't work.  I have a Motorola 360 watch and a Qi charging pad. The watch charges fine but this case doesn't. But hey, it looks nice.","Looks good, functions meh",2,3,82
1,Selfie Stick Fiblastiq&trade; Extendable Wireless Bluetooth Selfie Stick with built-in Bluetooth Adjustable Phone Holder,Wireless,"I’m embarrassed to admit that until recently, I have had a very negative opinion about “selfie sticks” aka “monopods” aka “narcissticks.” But having reviewed a number of them recently, they’re growing on me. This one is pretty nice and simple to set up and with easy instructions illustrated on the back of the box (not sure why some reviewers have stated that there are no instructions when they are clearly printed on the box unless they received different packaging than I did). Once assembled, the pairing via bluetooth and use of the stick are easy and intuitive. Nothing to it.<br /><br />The stick comes with a USB charging cable but arrived with a charge so you can use it immediately, though it’s probably a good idea to charge it right away so that you have no interruption of use out of the box. Make sure the stick is switched to on (it will light up) and extend your stick to the length you desire up to about a yard’s length and snap away.<br /><br />The phone clamp held the phone sturdily so I wasn’t worried about it slipping out. But the longer you extend the stick, the harder it is to maneuver.  But that will happen with any stick and is not specific to this one in particular.<br /><br />Two things that could improve this: 1) add the option to clamp this in portrait orientation instead of having to try and hold the stick at the portrait angle, which makes it feel unstable; 2) add the opening for a tripod so that this can be used to sit upright on a table for skyping and facetime eliminating the need to hold the phone up with your hand, causing fatigue.<br /><br />But other than that, this is a nice quality monopod for a variety of picture taking opportunities.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion.",A fun little gadget,4,0,319

25,Bluetooth Headphones TOSHENG In-Ear Wireless Hands-free Phone Earphone Sport Earbuds,Wireless,"Not bad. I LOVE these style of Bluetooth headsets. This one is slightly different from my very first pair I got over a year ago. They are the same shape but this one is not as finished as my current set.  The sound quality is not as clear as my QCY set but is pretty good. It has a nice balance of sound and the bass is sufficient. The sound quality is not like those expensive Beats or bose headphones, but it’s good enough for the price point. These go in the ear so it does block sound out. It blocks noise out so well that when I’m using these in the office, I can get more work done because I don’t hear the chatter of people around me.<br /><br />These use your standard micro usb cables so there’s no fear if you lose the cable that this set comes with. It charges up full in about an hour from dead and right out of the box it charged up in about 30 minutes. The battery life lasts me about 3 work days before needing to be recharged and that includes using it while on the way home from work which is a one hour minimum drive to and from the office.<br /><br />When using this for phone calls, you must leave the left ear piece hanging down around your neck. The microphone is on that earpiece. If you leave it in your ear, the person on the other end will not hear you clearly because the mic will be by your ear. The one thing this set is missing is a clip so you can clip that ear piece onto your collar for phone calls. If you’re like me and always moving around, if the earpieces shuffles around, the person on the phone can hear all the movement.<br /><br />Also, the volume button. It is very temperamental. When I try to hit volume up, I barely touch it and it adjusts volume. When I press down on it adjust volume it has a slow reaction. It’s almost like it works like a touch screen. Holding down the volume up and down buttons while listening to music will skip forward and back on your song list. With very minimal buttons, this is a very easy headset to use. It comes with an instructional booklet complete with photo to show you where the buttons and mic are.<br /><br />It comes with multiple ear pieces so you can change them out to the most comfortable size for you.<br /><br />I was provided a promotional sample for my honest review.s with an instructional booklet complete with photo to show you where the buttons and mic are.<br /><br />It comes with multiple ear pieces so you can change them out to the most comfortable size for you.<br /><br />I was provided a promotional sample for my honest review.",Not bad at all.,4,0,485

38,LG AKA H788 Mobile Phone (White) - International Version No Warranty,Wireless,"I'm not going to tell you that you should buy this phone, I'll givethe pros and the cons and let you decide for yourself Pros &#34;Durable&#34;    I don't know if Lg of America purposely makes they're phones in America easy to break the screen but this one Right here is a champion. Dropped this on cement, Hard Tile floor, on the sidewalk, and a few Other non carpeted areas. I don't know if it's the construction itself that makes it strong or maybe that LG Of Korea purposely made this phone very strong since it's marketed to teens and younger folks, or maybe it's because every time you dropped the phone instead of it's falling all in one piece and absorbing all the Impact, the back comes off and the battery comes out oftentimes but when you put it back together it works fine. I even had a few front facing dropS so many times I thought oh my God this is it my phone is shattered but I was wrong I am so confident in this phone that I Could do a ear height drop test anytime anywhere and I'm 100 percent sure it won't break and I'm 5ft 10. I don't even have a case on it it's just the screen protector and that's it.  Good Conversation starter (The Eyes)  you have no idea how many conversations have started Because of this.  Me: *Takes my phone out of my pocket to see notifications*  Her: &#34;Omg, does your phone have eyes? Thats sooo cute&#34;  Me:yeah, it's a lil phone from Korea. The Lg aka. check it out it's eye's move too. It even blinks too Her: Thats so adorable, Im ******* by the way.  Continue talking and i ended up getting so many kiks/phone number because of that but i digress. (It's Still Corvette over females doe) A great way to break the ice.  Audio  The Sounds sounds great coming through the speakers no cracking or nothing like that, it's not super loud but if you put it at full volume here and enjoy it even if you're a good distance away. earbuds, it works with every pair of earbuds I have very compatible. Crisp .plus with the LG software their version of the music app you have the option to increase t, the treble, all that. I love that features some songs just don't sound the same without all that bass.let's see what else can I say about the sound? the notifications can be nice and loud. And yeah if you're really into music this is a great phone.  Design   if you are coming from some other company and you're used to the buttons on the sideit'll take a little while but eventually you'll get used to the volume rockers and power button being on the back. and if you don't want to have to deal with that this phone has knock knock you tap on the screen twice to wake it up and then you can enter your password and all that instead of using the little button on the back. and most of the time you can use the littles options At top to adjust the volume but as I said before it's pretty easy To get used to. Plus the phone looks nice, its not ugly.  Call quality The call quality is decent. I thought since this phone was from overseas the call Quality might be off but now it's on point. Texting works normally too .  The speed  if you are used to be mid-range phones, this is quite a little Speedy One.   The Flex factor  lots of people buy Phones As fashion statement, the question is if my  put his galaxy/iPhone/Note/ on the table and you put yo phone next to theirs how would it stack up? I would give this phone a 7. Its pretty nice and if you keep it clean(its easy,every not and again wipe wit a lil rubbing alcohol) you can flex on anyone. Looks like one of them $700 Flagships. If yo guy friends see the eyes however they might clown ya. But that don't matter. The eyes are cool to me and that's all that matter.  Security Lots of options to keep it safe. Bunch of lock options and it has lookout too.at least mine did you might have to install it.  accessories  If you like customization this phone comes with funny lil stickers to put on it. If you older you might not care but i found this cool.  Weight  Its not heavy. I likes this.   OsThe operating system is Kitkat, I personally like KitKat. it gets the job done and it doesn't have too many features that I'll never use thatll just drain my battery.  Memory   16 gigs of internal space . And thats good considering my other phone before this had 8 . Up to 32 gb with a memory card but I used a 64 gb chip and it's worked fine.  Auto focus lazer  Cool feature on the camera very useful. And it can shoot high resolution video  Battery   lasts a while. I can get 6 hours wifi on heavy use but if the brightness is at 100 you lose some up time. And if yiu get a replacement battery you can just switch it out bam.  Cons  Camera isn't highest quality. Kinda grainy.  Not waterproof/Water resistant. Thats how my broke. Not broke but it's messed up pretty bad.   Price. Depending on what color you get this can go up to be 300 dollars, them Amazon vendors tryna rip y'all off this a $200/$250 Phone don't be rash wait till the price go down.  Front facing camera is not that great either but you can see so its not complete trash.  Too much stuff. Too many apps pulling on the ram makes it studder occasionally. Not bad but you'll notice it.   5 inches. I came from 4.7 in, i though well .3 in isn't that big of a jump but I was wrong, sometimes I have difficulty reaching the top of the screen to pull down my notification thing. Not the phone fault my hands just wasn't  for 5 in.   Micro sim. I had a regular sim. But its alright T-Mobile switch it and gave me a new one free.  I lied at the start. You should buy this if you think it's cool",Too Many people Sleeping on this phone,5,2,1110

51,Jaybird Freedom Sprint Bluetooth Headset  - Storm White,Wireless,"They sounded okay, they had plenty of the skipping that is all too well known with bluetooth headphones, very difficult for me to get the right fit with these. I wanted to like these headphones, but the Blue Buds X were just a hands down winner, the Blue Buds just have too many better features to go with freedoms instead. Durability wise, only time will tell. But these freedoms weren't as good sounding to me, the ear hooks were not as comfortable as I was expecting, I also prefer the Blue Buds due to their smaller size. The price is higher, I bit the bullet and bought them and I am so much happier with them than I was with the cheaper alternatives.

84,E-PRANCE EP-1512 Cigarette Lighter Power Adapter with 3 DC Sockets,Wireless,"It took a little time for me to write this review because I prefer to try a product out completely over time. I did have a problem with the cable, the camera would shut off when the car was in motion and I would have to screw around with the connector to get it to turn on again, after a few miles it would shut off again, this was corrected when I notified the company which promptly sent me a new cable. The problem now seems to be fixed. About the camera itself...it's a really good little camera, the picture is really clear and the colors are very natural. This camera rivals many more expensive models. Take a look at the YouTube videos, they speak for themselves. The only problem I have (with any of these cameras) is, the setting buttons are really small, for a man's hands that can be a problem, but other than that I really don't have any other complaints with this camera. It does what it was designed to do. The company is really nice to deal with if you do have a problem, like with any electronic device, things can and do go wrong sometimes, but this company responds quickly to rectify a problem which keeps their costumers happy. Over all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this very reasonably priced camera to any one looking to purchase a car camera.

87,Sentey LS-4560 B-trek H9 Bluetooth Wireless Foldable Headphones with Carrying Case,Wireless,"Works as described.  I bought it to have earphones with some noise blocking capability for use on a tractor.  I have ear-bud phones which block noise and these block better with better sound and no more gooey-squishy-sweat in my ear canals.  I have paired it with 2 tablets (one android, one Windows) and my phone all easily.  Good sound quality. Does not block enough outside sound to serve as hearing protection, nor would I expect it to, but it is close and works well for my needs in a tractor which isn't very loud.<br /><br />Pros:  Good sound quality.  Voice notifications lets you know on/off/pairing.  Comfortable (fits fully over my ears).  Range; I tried pairing to my phone when outside ready to hit the tractor and it wouldn't do it....came to realize it was still connected inside to my tablet which I had to go inside to disconnect.  Nice compact case.<br />Cons:  At this price point I can't complain.  The USB charger cable is unique and may be difficult to replace (USB to mic jack). They feel &#34;flimsy&#34; but then that means they are lightweight and comfortable for work-use or long games.<br />Unknowns:  I haven't run the battery dead yet to know run time; at least a few hours.  Microphone; haven't tried it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  when these wear out I will get another pair.  I will probably buy two more for my kids for road trips as they have systematically destroyed the &#34;wire&#34; with each wired set that I have bought them.",Work great and exceeded my expectations with both build and sound quality.

95,"TechMatte Car Mount MagGrip Windshield and Dashboard Universal Magnetic Car Mount With Device Holder for iPhone 6, 6S, Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge (Black)",Wireless,"I am VERY happy with this holder.  The suction mount and positioning abilities are very high quality.  I use a 5.5 inch screen phone and a thin, hard-shell case.  The thin, metal plate fits easily between the back of my phone and its case, and it holds very firmly on the TechMatte's magnet.  I don't need the gripper portion, although it is also very nice quality.  And while it holds firmly, it also comes off when I want to grab my phone.<br />What I like the most about this mount is the ability to quickly put the phone on, or take it off with one hand and no fumbling about.  You can place the phone on it lengthwise, or straight up and down without difficulty.  Once on, the phone doesn't move while I'm driving through any turns, stops, or bumps.  It's just plain easy, reliable and functional.<br />The mount's suction cup is the best I've ever used -- and I've used many over the years.  It'll hold firm on any windshield, or on a dashboard horizontal pad.  The angle adjustments are easy to use, also high quality, and they hold firmly once in place.<br />This product is absolute proof of &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  Sure, you can get a cheaper Chinese knock-off on Ebay...but it won't be anything nearly as good.

107,"Cootree Lightweight Sweatproof In-Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphone headsets for Jogger, Running, Sports, Exercise, Workout - Black",Wireless,"I like the style, I have a large head but these fit and stay in place, and they're cheap (notice I said cheap, not inexpensive).<br /><br />If they didn't cost so little (especially for wireless) I would rate lower but for $23 I got what I paid for.  They'll replace my corded headset for doing physical work but only because I've had it with ripping corded phones out of my ears. They won't replace my corded phones while at the office though.<br /><br />The drivers lack bass and there's a slight tunnel effect to the audio.  This is however my first Bluetooth headset so that may be typical. These are meant for wireless convenience and I'll give the sound quality a pass at this price point - they do what is necessary of them.  All of the buttons besides the MFB are conveniently placed and easy to use, but the MFB button is located towards the inside of the earbud instead of the back so you have to almost pull the the earbud out to access it - especially with the rubber &#34;waterproofers&#34; installed.<br /><br />I can't attest yet to the battery life.  If they last 5 hours at a time I'll be happy.<br /><br />The start/stop feature stops working occasionally and I have to unlock my phone before I can stop the music from the headset.  This may be an issue with my phone though, a Moto G first-gen.<br /><br />And finally the rubber buds were all but useless.  In the attached picture you'll see of the buds that came on the headphones (to the farthest right in the picture), one was larger (top) than the other (bottom).  And then the other 2 sets were defective in that the &#34;rim&#34; that attaches to the stem of the headphones is at the front of the earbuds instead of the back.  For instance if you look at the earbuds to the right of the picture (the ones that came on the headset) you'll notice (or not) the black rim is in the back.  But the other 2 sets (left and center) you'll notice the front of the buds are dark - that is the rim which is supposed to be in the back.So these other 2 sets only attach if you put them on backwards, i.e. with the &#34;output&#34; hole onto the stem.  I docked a star for this and thought about RMA'ing but because of shipping/handling charges and the fact that I have other rubber buds from other sets I've purchased in the past, I didn't bother.<br /><br />I was hoping for more but got about what I expected.  My biggest disappointment was in the defective rubber buds.","They're ""Ok""",3,0,459

In just two weeks of use, this thing has told me to &#34;leave the road&#34; twice, and taken me to a gas station that hasn't been a gas station in years.  The first time I used it, I was in a familiar area, and if I hadn't known that the GPS was trying to take me down horse path (literally) I'd have been in trouble. I'm pretty disappointed at the accuracy, and the database is just 'so-so'.  And, it took 14 hours to &#34;update&#34; the database from my USB on my computer, which I did right out of the box.

132,For Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 (5.5),Wireless,"First off, the seller was Great. Item arrived in a very timely manner. The actual materials of this 3 piece case appear to be very rugged. The only exception might be the belt clip (time will tell). However, once you put the silicone gel around the phone, then proceed to slide the phone into the middle bracing part, you have no way to avoid putting stress on the volume rocker and power buttons. You just have to work those buttons into the cutouts. If, like me, you choose to use the belt clip case, inserting and removing the phone can be a challenge. At first, I found myself accidentally taking screen shots because of the pressure being put on the power and volume rocker buttons while sliding the phone in and out of the belt clip case (very tight). Plus the gel covering tends to fold up when pulling phone out. The solution? Well, this is a &#34;flip screen phone,&#34; so I just put it into the belt clip case right side up even though I would rather put it in right side down (The reason: hand down at side to hand up at ear. Results when I pull the phone out, the phone goes from right side down in case to right side up at ear). Overall Pros: 1) Material used appear to be very durable. 2) Kickstand seems to work very well. Overall Cons: 1) Phone is tight in belt clip. 2) Silicone gel gets a lot of friction when putting in and pulling out of belt clip case. 3) Although silicone gel cover has some notches on the sides, feels a little slick. 4) Molded area for earphone plug isn't big enough for a complete flush connection. ...

Car chargers like this are of great help, because they allow you to secure your phone's battery life, while not taking up extensive amounts of space that could obstruct your tasks of shifting gears, etc. The product is very durable and well made, and it is not of cheap material. I highly recommend this for people who are on the go, but have important tasks to complete through phone usage.","Portable, durable, handy",5,0,118
228,iClever Charger,Wireless,"My husband and I got this before a trip recently. It was so useful and we are so glad we had it! Whenever our phone batteries got low, we plugged them into this power bank and they charged right up. The unit has a lot of power and is perfect for airplanes or day trips when you don't have constant access to a charger. We didn't have to conserve our phone batteries and were able to use our phones as we normally would, taking pictures, checking email, etc.  It has a little pouch that it fits into which was convenient. It is kind of an awkward size and would be inconvenient to carry around if you don't have a bag or a purse, since you need to have charging cables as well. I always carry large purses, so this wasn't a problem for us.  I like that this power bank has a power switch as well, and it tells you how much battery remains. It has a flashlight on it as well, which I don't think we really have used, but I guess it would be nice for trying to plug in your phone in the dark. We charged this power bank every night (by plugging it into the wall) and always had enough power for 2 smart phones throughout the day. So convenient that you can plug 2 devices in at once.  If you can get this for a good price, I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this portable battery charger to anyone who uses their phone constantly!",Must have!,5,6,260

It looks elegant. It has a stainless steel body and genuine leather band.  The band maximum width 7.5\\"" (last hole), if needed additional holes could be made to make it as wide as 8\\"".<br /><br />The face of the watch is 1 3/16\\"" wide and the watch is 1/4\\"" thick. The back of the watch states it has Japanese quartz movement.  The watch is water resistant to rain and splashing but cannot be submerged into water.<br /><br />This watch is made in China but includes an English manual. The manual covers several watches so it is a somewhat confusing as it refers to self-winding watches as well as quartz watches like this one.  The third page in the manual can be used as a guide to the watch adjustment method.  I found the controls to be simple, everything is controlled by the position of the crown. It can be pulled out into two position, the first position allows change the day of the month, the second position moves the arms.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch.  It comes in attractive package, the box has a pillow and include a gift bag.<br /><br />This watch is provided by BUREI for review.  Getting a review product does not influence what I say, I leave critical reviews as well as positive reviews like this one.<br /><br />Ali Julia review",A classy looking watch,5,5,246
