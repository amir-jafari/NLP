# Seq2Seq Model Training

This document describes the implementation and training of a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model using PyTorch. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The training process is demonstrated with dummy data.

## Components

### Encoder

The encoder processes the input sequence and returns the hidden states for each time step as well as the final hidden state.
