Kites were invented in China, where materials ideal for kite building were readily
available: silk fabric for sail material; fine, high-tensile-strength silk for flying line;
and resilient bamboo for a strong, lightweight framework.

The kite has been claimed as the invention of the 5th-century BC Chinese
philosophers Mozi (also Mo Di) and Lu Ban (also Gongshu Ban). By 549 AD
paper kites were certainly being flown, as it was recorded that in that year a paper
kite was used as a message for a rescue mission. Ancient and medieval Chinese
sources describe kites being used for measuring distances, testing the wind, lifting
men, signaling, and communication for military operations. The earliest known
Chinese kites were flat (not bowed) and often rectangular. Later, tailless kites
incorporated a stabilizing bowline. Kites were decorated with mythological motifs
and legendary figures; some were fitted with strings and whistles to make musical
sounds while flying. From China, kites were introduced to Cambodia, Thailand,
India, Japan, Korea and the western world.

After its introduction into India, the kite further evolved into the fighter kite, known
as the patang in India, where thousands are flown every year on festivals such as
Makar Sankranti.

Kites were known throughout Polynesia, as far as New Zealand, with the
assumption being that the knowledge diffused from China along with the people.
Anthropomorphic kites made from cloth and wood were used in religious ceremonies
to send prayers to the gods. Polynesian kite traditions are used by anthropologists get
an idea of early “primitive” Asian traditions that are believed to have at one time
existed in Asia.
